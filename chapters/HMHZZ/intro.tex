\section{Introduction}

A new particle was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC~\cite{20121, 201230} in 2012.
Both two experiments have confirmed that the properties including spin, couplings and parity of this new particle are consistent with 
Higgs boson predicted in the Standard Model (SM), which is an important milestone in understanding of the mechanism of EWSB.
Nevertheless, the possibility that this newly discoved particle is just a part of the extended Higgs sector
as predicted by various extensions in the SM cannot be ruled out.
There are many models predicted the existence of new heavy resonances decaying into dibosons, 
such as the electroweak-singlet model of a heavy spin-0 neutral Higgs boson~\cite{PhysRevD.36.3463}
and the two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM)~\cite{BRANCO20121}, 
as well as the spin-2 Kaluzaâ€“Klein (KK) excitations of the graviton (GKK)~\cite{DAVOUDIASL200043}.
