\section{Introduction}

A new particle was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC~\cite{20121, 201230} in 2012.
Both two experiments have confirmed that the properties including spin, couplings and parity of this new particle are consistent with 
Higgs boson predicted in the Standard Model (SM), which is an important milestone in understanding of the mechanism of EWSB.
Nevertheless, the possibility that this newly discoved particle is just a part of the extended Higgs sector
as predicted by various extensions in the SM cannot be ruled out.
There are many models predicted the existence of new heavy resonances decaying into dibosons, 
such as a heavy spin-0 neutral Higgs boson~\cite{PhysRevD.36.3463}
and the two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM)~\cite{BRANCO20121}, 
as well as the spin-2 Kaluzaâ€“Klein (KK) excitations of the graviton ($G_{KK}$)~\cite{DAVOUDIASL200043}.

Though with smaller branching ratio comparing to semileptonic or fully hadronic decay channels, the \llll final states have its unique sensitivity in mass range smaller than 1~\tev~region due to its good mass resolution and relative small experimental and theoretical systematics.
This section presents the search for heavy resonance decaying into a pair of $Z$ bosons to the \llll final states, in which $l$ denotes to either an electron or a muon. 
Several signal hypothesises are considered.
The first hypothesis is a heavy Higgs boson (spin-0 resonance) under the narrow-width approximation (NWA).
Then since several theoretical models prefer non-negligible natural widths, the models under large-width approximation (LWA), 
assuming widths of 1\%, 5\% and 10\% of the resonance mass, are also studied.
It is assumed that the heavy resonance is produced predominantly via the gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) and the vector-boson fusion (VBF), 
but with the unknown ratio of two production rates.
So the results are separated for ggF and VBF production modes.
To gain more sensitivity, the \llll events are classified into  ggF- and VBF-enriched categories.
Moreover, for the NWA model, the categorizations are  studied under both cut-based and DNN-based methods, whose details of categorization are shown in following sections.

The search uses the four-lepton invariant mass in the range of 200~\gev~to~2000~\gev~for signal hypothesis of spin-0 resonance under the NWA model,
and from 400~\gev~to 1500~\gev~for the one under the LWA models.
The data collected by ATLAS detector at the LHC from 2015 to 2018 at the centre-of-mass energy of 13~\tev~is used.
In case of no excess, upper limits on the production rate of different signal hypothesises are computed from statistical fits to $m_{4l}$ distribution
in the ggF production of a heavy scalar under both NWA and LWA models, and in the VBF production only under NWA model.
