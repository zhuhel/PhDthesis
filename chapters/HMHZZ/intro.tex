\section{Introduction}

In the year of 2012, a new particle was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at LHC\cite{20121, 201230}.
Both two experimets have confirmed that the properties including spin, couplings and parity of this new particle are consistent with 
Higgs boson predicted in Standard Model (SM), which is an important milestone in understanding of the mechanism of EWSB.
Nevertheless, one question is whether this particle is just a part of the extended Higgs sector
or other extension of the SM cannot be ruled out.
Many models predicted the existence of new heavy resonances decaying into dibosons, 
include the extension of Higgs sector such as the two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM)\cite{},
