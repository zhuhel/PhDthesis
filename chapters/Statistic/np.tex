\section{Nuisance parameters}

The expected numbers and pdf shapes of signal and background events also depend on a series of systematic uncertainties, 
which are described as a set of nuisance parameters (NPs).
As showed in equation~\ref{eq:likelihoodf}, $\pmb{\theta}$ is a set of NPs that plays as an additional ``penalty" term to likelihood function, 
which will increase the negative log likelihood when any nuisance parameter is shifted from its nominal value.
Usually those NPs are constrained by using Gaussian function with their estimated uncertainties provided by the experiment condition.
