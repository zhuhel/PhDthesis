\chapter{Statistical treatment of searching for new particles or processes}
\label{sec:statisticalfit}

In the experiments of particle physics, one often searches for particles or processes that have been predicted but not yet observed, such as the two analysis presented in this dissertation: searching for the vector boson scattering process and searching for the heavy resonance(s).
Usually two hypotheses are defined:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $H_{0}$: null hypothesis, in most cases are designated as background-only hypothesis.
    \item $H_{1}$: signal plus background hypothesis, where signal is a new model one would like to search for.
\end{itemize}
For the purpose of discovering a new signal process, the $H_{0}$ hypothesis is tested against the alternative $H_{1}$.
When setting limits, the $H_{1}$ hypotheses with different signal strengths are tested against the $H_{0}$.

The level of agreement between observed data and a given hypothesis can be quantified by computing the $p$-value, the probability under this hypothesis assumption, or its equivalent Gaussian significance.
This section describes the statistical treatment for searches related to this dissertation.
