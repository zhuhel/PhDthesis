\chapter{Simulation and Object Reconstruction for the ATLAS Experiment}

In current LHC pp collison, bunches of protons collide every 25 nanoseconds (ns), which gives a large challenge to event reconstruction and selections.
To predict and model each process, the Monte Carlo simulations of physics events are essential for high-energy physics experiments.
This section will briefly discuss the event simulation and reconstruction programs based on the ATLAS software framework.
