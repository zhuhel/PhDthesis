\chapter{Simulation and Event Reconstruction for the ATLAS Experiment}

In current LHC pp collison, bunches of protons collide every 25 nanoseconds (ns), which gives a large challenge to event reconstruction and selections.
To predict and model each process, the Monte Carlo simulations of physics events are essential for high-energy physics experiments.
This section will briefly discuss the event simulation and reconstruction programs based on the ATLAS software framework.

\section{Event reconstruction}

The data flow of ATLAS data processing is sketched in figure~\ref{fig:data_processing}\cite{Boyd_2010}. 
Data from detector is firstly filtered by online trigger system and then send to the \textit{Tier-0 (T0)} for initial processing by offline reconstruction software also based on Athena.
A small amount of data named "express stream" is processed in almost real time in T0 for online data quality monitoring.
In addition, some other dedicated data steams are sent out at trigger level for detector alignment and calibration.
These calibration and alignment information are then used for bulk reconstruction in T0.
At the end of the reconstruction chain, the data are delivered into \textit{Tier-1 (T1)} and \textit{Tier-2 (T2)} centers for further analysis and production of simulated data.
Besides, T1 centers are also responsible for data reprocessing by re-running data reconstruction with improved calibration and alignment constants and with improved reconstruction algorithms.
This section describes the reconstruction of some important physics objects in ATLAS experiment, i.e. tracks, vertices, electrons, muons, jets, and missing energies.
