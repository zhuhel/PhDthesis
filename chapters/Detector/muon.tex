\subsection{Muon spectrometer}

Muon spectrometer is the outermost part of the ATLAS detector with an extremely large tracking system.
It measures a large range of muon momentum, and the accuracy can be about 3\% at 100 GeV and 10\% at 1 TeV.
The muon spectrometer is comprised of three main parts: a magnetic field produced by three toroidal magnets;
a set of chambers measuring the tracks of muons with high spatial precision; and triggering chambers with accurate time-resolution. 
Figure~\ref{fig:muon_dec} shows the schematic of ATLAS muon spectrometer, from which you can see four types of muon chambers 
(\textit{MDT, CSC, RPC, TGC}) as well as the magnet systems (barrel and end-cap toroid).

The details of four-type chambers are given as belows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT)}. MDTs provide the precise momentum measurment with the $|\eta|$ range up to 2.7, except in the innermost end-cap layer where the coverage is limited to $|\eta| < 2.0$. The chambers are comprised of three or eight layers of drift tubes, with a diameter of 29.970 mm, operated with Ar/CO2 gas (93/7) at 3 bar. The average resolution can reach 80 $\mu$m per tube and 30 $\mu$m per chamber.
	\item \textbf{Cathode strip chambers (CSC)}. CSCs are used in the forward region of $2 < |\eta| < 2.7$ in the innermost tracking layers, due to their good time resolution and high rate capability. The CSCs are multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) with the cathode planes segmented into strips in orthogonal directions, which alows both coordinates to be measured from the induced-charge distribution. The resolution of a chamber is about 40 $\mu$m for bending plane and 5 mm for the transverse plane.
	\item \textbf{Resistive plate chambers (RPC)}. The RPCs serves as fast triggers in the barrel region of $|\eta| < 1.05$ due to the high rate capability and good spatial and time resolution. It is a gaseous parallel electrode-plate detector without any wires. There are three concentric cylindrical layers around the beam axis, referred to as the three trigger stations. Each stations consists of two independent layers to measure the transverse coordinates of $\eta$ and $\phi$.
	\item \textbf{Thin gap chambers (TGC)}. TGCs are used as trigger system for the end-cap region of $1.5 < |\eta| < 2.4$, and operated based on the same principle as multi-wire proportional chambers. In additon, they can also provide the second azimuthal coordinate to complement the measurement of MDT in bending direction.
