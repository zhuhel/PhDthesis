\subsection{Detector overview}

ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) is the largest volume detector ever constructed for a particle collider.
It has the dimensions of a cylinder with 46 meters long, 25 meters in diameter, and sits in a cavern 100m below ground. 
The ATLAS detector weighs 7000 tonnes, similar to the weight of the Eiffel Tower.
