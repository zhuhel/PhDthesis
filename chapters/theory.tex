\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
The standard model (SM) reflects our current understanding of elementary particles and several basic interactions.
It is a gauge quantum field theory containing the internal symmetries of the unitary product group $SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)$, 
in which the color group $SU(3)$ presents the strong interaction, and $SU(2) × U(1)$ describes the electroweak interactions.
Over the past decades, the SM has been widely tested through various experiments with extremely high precision.

\section{Phenomenology of Large Hadron Collider}
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was built as a bridge between the theories and the experiment.
Physicists hope that the LHC can help to answer some of the fundamental open questions in physics, 
concerning the basic laws of interactions and forces among the elementary particles, 
the deep structure of space and time, and in particular the interrelation between quantum mechanics and general relativity.
This section will talk about firstly the general introduction of Physics inside hadronic collision,
then followed by two important LHC phenomenology of the Higgs physics and Diboson physics which is related closely to this thesis.
