%\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\section{Elementary Particles and Interactions in the Standard Model}
The standard model (SM) reflects our current understanding of elementary particles and several basic interactions.
It is a gauge quantum field theory containing the internal symmetries of the unitary product group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$, 
in which the color group $SU(3)$ represents the strong interaction, and $SU(2) \times U(1)$ describes the electroweak interactions.
Over the past decades, the SM has been widely tested through various experiments with extremely high precision.

\section{Phenomenology of Large Hadron Collider}
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{Bruning:2004ej, Buning:2004wk, Benedikt:2004wm} was built as a bridge between the experiments and the theories.
Physicists hope that the LHC can help to answer some open questions in fundamental physics, 
such as the basic laws of interactions, the forces among the elementary particles, 
the deep structure of space and time, and the interrelation between quantum mechanics and general relativity.
This section will talk about firstly the general introduction of Physics inside hadronic collision,
then followed by two important LHC phenomenologies of the Higgs physics and Diboson physics that are related closely to this dissertation.
