\chapter{The Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS Detector}

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
Located near the French-Swiss border at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest and most powerful facility for particle physics in the world.
It's the proton-proton collider with the centre-of-mass energy designed up to 14~\tev.
The beams inside the LHC are made to collide at four locations around its 27-kilometer accelerator ring, 
corresponding to four particle experiments - the ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb.
With its unprecedented energy, the LHC is designed to observe physics that involve highly massive particles,
which have never been observed in previous accelerators with lower energies.
