\chapter{The Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS Detector}

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
Located near the French-Swiss border at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world’s largest and most powerful particle collider.
It's the proton-proton collider with center-of-mass energy up to 14 TeV.
The beams inside the LHC are made to collide at four locations around its 27-kilometer accelerator ring, 
corresponding to the positions of four particle detectors – ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb.
With its unprecedented energy, the LHC is designed to observe physics that involve highly massive particles
which have never been observable in earlier lower energy accelerators.
