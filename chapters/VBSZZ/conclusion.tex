\section{Conclusion}

The fiducial cross section for inclusive $ZZjj$ production is measured in this section, with a total relative uncertainty of 11\% for the \llll final state,
and found to be compatible with the SM prediction.
The observation of electroweak production of two jets in association with a $Z$-boson pair decay to \llll final state 
using 139~\ifb of 13~\tev~pp collision data collected by ATLAS experiment at the LHC is presented in this section.
The search for electroweak production of two jets in association with a $Z$-boson pair is based on multivariate discriminants (MD) to enhance the separation between the signal and backgrounds.
In \llll final state, the background-only hypothesis is rejected with an observed (expected) significance of 5.5 (3.9)~$\sigma$,
which gives the first observation of electroweak production in $ZZjj$ channel.

In addition, the prospect study for the EW-$ZZjj$ production at the HL-LHC in the \llll channel, using 3000~\ifb~ simulated pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 14~\tev~has been presented.
The precision of the expected measurements of the integrated and differential cross sections as a function of dijet or \llll invariant mass are shown.
Under the assumption of theoretical uncertainty for the QCD-$ZZjj$ processes 
and experimental uncertainty for jets being constraint at 5\% level respectively, 
with statistical uncertainty in 3000~\ifb being considered, 
the observation of the EW-$ZZjj$ process can reach a significance of 7~$\sigma$.
