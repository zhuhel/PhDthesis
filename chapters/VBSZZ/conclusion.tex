\section{Conclusion}

The fiducial cross section for inclusive $ZZjj$ production is measured in this section, with a total relative uncertainty of 11\% for the \lllljj final state,
and found to be compatible with the SM prediction.
The observation of electroweak production of two jets in association with a Z-boson pair decay to \llll final state 
using 139~\ifb of 13~\tev pp collision data collected by ATLAS experiment at LHC is presented in this section.
The search for electroweak production of two jets in association with a Z-boson pair is based on multivariate discriminants (MD) to enhance the separation between the signal and backgrounds.
In \llll final state, the background-only hypothesis is rejected with an observed (expected) significance of 5.5 (3.9)~$\sigma$,
which gives the first observation of electroweak production in $ZZjj$ channel.

In addition, the prospect study for the EW-$ZZjj$ production at the HL-LHC in the \llll channel, using 3000~\ifb simulated pp collision at a centre-of-mass energy of 14~\tev has been presented.
The precision of the expected measurements of the integrated and differential cross sections as a function of dijet or 4l invariant mass are shown.
Under the assumption of theoretical uncertainty being constraint at 5\% level for the QCD-$ZZjj$ processes, 
the observation of the EW-$ZZjj$ process can be reached with a significance of 7~$\sigma$.
