\section{Systematics}

The analysis performances both the statistical fit to MD distribution to extract the EW-ZZjj contributions
and the cross section measurements in fiducial volume.
Therefore, theoretical and experimental uncertainties may affect the predictions background yields and shapes, 
correction factors from detector-level to particle-level measurement, as well as the $ZZjj$ MD shapes and so on.
Moreover, the statistical uncertainties of simulated samples are also taken into account.
And due to the extramely low cross section of \llll channel, the analysis is still data statistic dominanted.
This section will described the measurement of both theoretical and experimental systematics for $ZZjj$ productions.
The systematics for fake backgrounds have been elaborated in section~\ref{sec:fake_syst}.
